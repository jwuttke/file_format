Follow-up on meeting of 30sep20 - Joachim Wuttke.

## Efficient meetings

Technical discussion in a large committee tend to be lengthy,
unfocussed, and unconclusive. While it was good to have an
open discussion today, a more stringent agenda is needed if
we are to reach specific decisions.

For topics that are yet unclear, convoke focussed meetings
of specially interested people.

In full assembly, give precedence to topics for which
resolutions have been proposed in writing.

## Opt-out allowed

The standard should consist of different chapters with minimal
interdependences so that stakeholders who have problems with
some chapter may nonetheless find a meaningful way to conform
with other chapters.

## Incremental standardization

Put single chapter for vote as soon as they are mature.
